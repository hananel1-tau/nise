                    <h3 class="section-subheading">
                        Many elderly people who live alone (in private apartments or elderly houses), while still mostly independent, might have some difficulties with day to day activities. Those of them who are having trouble accepting these difficulties or are very privy about their privacy, are often refusing any sort of intrusive monitoring systems, like cameras or any sort of wearable monitoring technology. This refusal often leads to conflicts between them and their families/caregivers, and might result in them not having any monitoring at all.<br><br>

                        Our NISE (Non-Intrusive Smart Elderly) Monitoring System provides the elderly with an easy-to-install non-intrusive monitoring system in their house, that doesn't require of them any active actions (like turning on cameras or putting on wearable devices), but still provides them necessary supervision, and their families and caregivers - greater peace of mind over the well-being and safety of their relatives.<br><br>

                        Through the help of PIR sensors, our system is able to monitor daily activities habits, and alert caregivers when irregular patterns are detected, as per their pre-configured alerts logic, or, if they choose to, as per our anomaly detection logic.<br><br>

                        With our system, caregivers are able to view the activity from all sensors, or just some of them. With our dashboard, they can see how the activity is changing between different hours of the day, between different days of the week, and between different sensors.<br><br>

                        They can also set smart alerts, to notify them via SMS about anything they want, for example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alert when there wasn't any activity from some sensor for more then some threshold.</li>
                            <li>Alert when the person has been in the same room for more than some threshold.</li>
                        </ul>

                        The NISE monitoring system is a great product both for elderly homes, where staff can use it to more easily offer help and care, and for private homes where only one person lives.<br><br>

                        Aside from eldely people, it can also be useful for any person with disabilities who lives alone, both for continuous or just temporary (while recovering from accidents, for example) supervision.

                            <li>After the customer logs in, they configure the device by giving it a name and setting its location. No need to worry about the device ID, we've filled that in for you!</li>
                            <li>The customer physically places the devices at the appropriate places, like the bathroom, and turns them on.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Alternatively, the customer can log into our website and manually register the device using the corresponding device ID.

                            We used an ESP8266 device with one PIR (i.e., motion detection) sensor. Once every half a minute, or when enough events are detected, the device sends the events to the cloud to be processed, which are used to create the alerts.<br><br>

                            The device is given to the customer with a device ID and WiFi credentials already embedded in its code.<br>
                            To save battery, the device switches off WiFi when not using it.<br><br>

                            The device runs with the following logic:<br>
                            1. On startup, The device connects to a preconfigured WiFi network, initializes its<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internal clock using NTP and switches WiFi off.<br>
                            2. After initialization, the devices runs the following loop:<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. It checks the PIR sensor's state.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. If the PIR sensor's state has changed, save this event in an events buffer.<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. When the events buffer is full or half a minute has passed since the last<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transmission, the device connects to the preconfigured WiFi network, connects to<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cloud, sends the events and switches WiFi off again.

                                The PIR sensor's capture angle: Our PIR sensor has a wide angle. Therefore, it captures movememnt in the general vicinity of it, and not just movement directly in front of it, which is the desired behaviour.<br>
                                Our solution to this problem is to partially "blind" the sensor - we wrap it in a box which blocks everything not in front of it.

                                The ESP8266 and switching WiFi on & off: Since we want to save battery, we need to switch WiFi off when not transmitting events to the cloud. This sometimes caused the device to crash and restart because of its software watchdog - the ESP8266 has a software watchdog which expects to be signalled every once in a while. This is usually done at the end of the loop, which is quick enough, but transmitting events - which includes connecting to WiFi, connecting to the cloud, sending the events and switching WiFi off - takes too much time.<br>
                                Our solution to this problem is to signal the software watchdog manually in several points, like after connecting to WiFi and after connecting to the cloud.
